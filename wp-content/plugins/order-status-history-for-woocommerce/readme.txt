== Description ==

*Order Status History for WooCommerce* (OSHWOO) speeds up your daily analysis and processing of orders. Unobtrusive visual cues in all the orders screens show when someone has ordered from your shop before, your (most) repeating customers, and spurts of unusual activity (like  customers with due payments and cancellations).

= Main features =

* A graphical add-on for WooCommerce. Simply install and you're ready to go
* For each Order in the *Orders* table, get additional data displayed, like: has a customer ordered before, repeatedness, and unusual behavior (e.g. due payments and cancellations)
* The newly added *Order history column* is also sortable. The Shop Manager now can easily discern their most repeating customers, or those with the most issues, for example
* Shows Order history statuses as color swatches in 3 different places: the *Orders* page, the *Edit Order* page, and the *Users* page 
* Status colors are fully customizable, including the default WooCommerce statuses. Many color themes also available, inspired from major shopping carts
* Can work in conjunction with, or replace altogether, the default WooCommerce status swatches
* Fully supports Guest, registered Customer, and mixed Guest / Customer Orders
* Detailed reports of past Orders,  purchased Products, and all notes sent to Customer or private, for any registered or Guest Customer 
* CSV export of Orders, Products, and Notes reports
* Support of composite products within Reports
* Multi-currency support, with some extra usability features
* Translation-ready
* Completely free, with no limitations. Donations welcome.
